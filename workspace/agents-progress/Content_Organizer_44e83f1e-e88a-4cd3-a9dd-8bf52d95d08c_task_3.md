## Task Description
Retrieve research findings from memory. Organize the information into a structured Markdown format with sections: Title, Date/Time, Venue, Program List (if available), Performers, Theme, Sources, and Notes about information reliability. Clearly mark any unconfirmed or speculative information.

## Result
## Task Complete: Research Findings Organization

I've searched the long-term memory for research findings and created a structured Markdown document. Here's the summary:

### Search Results:
- **Memory Query**: Searched for "research findings event information program performers venue"
- **Results Found**: **None** - No research data exists in memory

### Document Created:
📄 **`research_findings_summary.md`** - A complete structured report with all requested sections:

| Section | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Title | ❌ Not Available |
| Date/Time | ❌ Not Available |
| Venue | ❌ Not Available |
| Program List | ❌ Not Available |
| Performers | ❌ Not Available |
| Theme | ❌ Not Available |
| Sources | ✅ Documented (memory search conducted) |
| Reliability Notes | ✅ Comprehensive gap analysis |

### Key Observations:
⚠️ **Critical Issue**: No research findings exist in memory to organize. This correlates with the team context errors showing Web_Researcher failures (400 InternalError).

### Recommendations:
1. **Resolve Web_Researcher errors** before attempting data collection
2. **Re-run research collection** once tool errors are fixed
3. **Verify data storage** process is functioning correctly

All unavailable information is clearly marked as **"Not Available"** with appropriate warnings about the data gaps. The document maintains professional formatting while being transparent about the absence of source material.
