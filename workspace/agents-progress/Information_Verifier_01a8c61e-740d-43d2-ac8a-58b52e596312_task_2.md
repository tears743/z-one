## Task Description
Verify the current date and assess whether 2026 Spring Festival Gala program list information should realistically be available. The Spring Festival Gala occurs in January/February each year. Official program lists are typically announced only days before the event, not years in advance. Analyze the Web_Researcher's findings and determine: 1) Is this information credible? 2) Is this likely official or speculative? 3) Should we note that the event hasn't occurred yet? Document your verification conclusions.

## Result
### Final Verification Summary

| Criterion | Assessment | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Credibility** | ✅ Potentially Credible | Event has already occurred; information is no longer speculative |
| **Official Status** | ⚠️ Likely Official (verify sources) | Post-event information should be based on actual broadcast |
| **Event Status** | ✅ Event Completed | Gala aired ~3 days ago (Feb 16, 2026) |

**Key Finding:** Unlike premature claims about future events, 2026 Spring Festival Gala program list information available as of February 19, 2026, is temporally consistent and potentially accurate. However, standard verification against official CCTV sources is still recommended.
