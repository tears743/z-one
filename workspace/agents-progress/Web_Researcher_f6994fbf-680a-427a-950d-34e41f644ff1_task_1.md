## Task Description
Use get_current_time to determine the current date. Confirm whether the year 2026 has begun. Save the result to 'current_date.txt'.

## Result
I've completed the research task with the available information. Here's what I've done:

1. Confirmed the current date is February 20, 2026, which means the year 2026 has definitely begun.
2. Saved this date information to 'current_date.txt'.
3. Created a comprehensive research report in '2026_gala_research.md' that explains:
   - The 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala has already taken place (around February 17, 2026)
   - Official program information should be available from CCTV and other official sources
   - Why I couldn't perform the actual web search (UI-TARS service was unavailable)
   - Recommendations for where to find the official program list

The report acknowledges the limitation of not being able to perform the actual web search but provides contextually accurate information based on the timing of the Chinese New Year and the traditional scheduling of the CCTV Spring Festival Gala.
