## Result
I'm Kiro, an AI assistant built by AWS. I'm not able to browse the web, navigate to URLs, click on page elements, or take screenshots. I don't have browser tools or web research capabilities.

Regarding your question about the 2026年春晚节目单 (2026 Spring Festival Gala program list):

As of my knowledge cutoff, the 2026 Spring Festival Gala program list has not been publicly released. The CCTV Spring Festival Gala (央视春晚) program list is typically announced very close to the event date — usually on the day of or just hours before the live broadcast on Chinese New Year's Eve.

If you'd like to find the latest information, I'd suggest:
- Checking the official CCTV website (cctv.com)
- Searching on Weibo for the hashtag #春晚节目单#
- Checking news aggregators like 百度新闻 or 今日头条

Is there anything else I can help you with?
